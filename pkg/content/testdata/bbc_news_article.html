                <p class="introduction"><b>The year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest on record, with global temperatures reaching 1.48C above pre-industrial levels, scientists have announced.</b></p>

                <p>Data from multiple international agencies shows that every month from June to December set new temperature records, marking an unprecedented period of global warming.</p>

                <p>The findings come as world leaders prepare for crucial climate talks, with scientists warning that the window for limiting warming to 1.5C is rapidly closing.</p>

                <h2>Record-breaking heat</h2>

                <p>According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), 2023 surpassed 2016 as the warmest year since records began in 1850. The data shows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Global average temperature was 14.98C, 0.17C higher than 2016</li>
                    <li>Every month from June onwards was the warmest on record</li>
                    <li>September saw the largest temperature anomaly at 0.93C above average</li>
                </ul>

                <p>"The extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilisation developed," said Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S.</p>

                <div class="inline-quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"This has been an extraordinary year for global temperatures. We are now dangerously close to breaching the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris Agreement."</p>
                        <cite>Dr Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of C3S</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <h2>Contributing factors</h2>

                <p>Scientists point to several factors behind the record temperatures:</p>

                <p><b>El Niño:</b> The natural climate pattern returned in 2023, adding to human-caused warming. However, researchers stress that El Niño alone cannot explain the magnitude of temperature increases.</p>

                <p><b>Greenhouse gases:</b> Atmospheric CO2 reached 421 parts per million in 2023, the highest level in over 3 million years.</p>

                <p><b>Ocean temperatures:</b> Sea surface temperatures also broke records, with marine heatwaves affecting over 90% of the ocean at some point during the year.</p>

                <h2>Global impacts</h2>

                <p>The record temperatures have been linked to extreme weather events worldwide:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Devastating wildfires in Canada, Hawaii, and southern Europe</li>
                    <li>Severe flooding in Libya, Greece, and Brazil</li>
                    <li>Record-breaking heatwaves across Asia, Europe, and North America</li>
                    <li>Accelerated ice loss in Antarctica and Greenland</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>

                <h2>Looking ahead</h2>

                <p>Climate scientists warn that without immediate and drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such extreme years could become the norm rather than the exception.</p>

                <p>"We still have a chance to limit warming to 1.5C, but it requires unprecedented action in this decade," said Professor Michael Mann from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

                <p>The findings will add urgency to discussions at the upcoming COP29 climate summit, where nations will review progress on emission reduction commitments.</p>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p class="byline">By Matt McGrath, Environment correspondent</p>
                    <p>These latest figures confirm what many scientists have long feared - that climate change is accelerating faster than predicted. The 1.5C threshold, once seen as a distant target, now appears perilously close.</p>
                    <p>What's particularly concerning is the rate of change. Just a decade ago, such temperatures would have been considered highly unlikely. Now they're reality.</p>
                    <p>The question facing world leaders is no longer whether we can prevent warming, but how quickly we can adapt to a rapidly changing world while still trying to limit further temperature rises.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What can be done?</h2>

                <p>Experts say urgent action is needed across multiple fronts:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Renewable energy:</b> Accelerate the transition from fossil fuels</li>
                    <li><b>Energy efficiency:</b> Improve building standards and transportation</li>
                    <li><b>Nature-based solutions:</b> Protect and restore forests and wetlands</li>
                    <li><b>International cooperation:</b> Strengthen climate commitments and financing</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the findings "a deafening wake-up call" and urged world leaders to treat climate change as the existential crisis it represents.</p>
